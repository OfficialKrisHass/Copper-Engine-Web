Welcome to the first article on the Copper-Engine website. This one serves more as a test of the system and if it's working.

Following this there will be a bunch of random stuff to test and configure the look of different formatting options.

## Subtitle
This is a **_subtitle_**, used for sections and stuff. Maybe I will implement a side bar that allows users to jump to individiual sections, hmmm.

![image caption](/articles/media/CopperPromotional.png)

Here is an unordered list.
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
    * Subitem
- Fourth item

### Secondary subtitle
Smaller subtitle, further section that contains an ordered list this time.

1. Eins
2. Zwei
3. Drei
    1. Meow
4. Vier

## Second section I guess
Here is quote from our dear leader Kris.
> I go meow, I go wruff, but I will never go waah

### Subsection
Here is the entire source of `Copper-Engine`TM.

```
int main() {
	
	Engine engine;
	engine.Run();
	
	return 0;
	
}
```

#### Tertiary subtitle
Once more.
